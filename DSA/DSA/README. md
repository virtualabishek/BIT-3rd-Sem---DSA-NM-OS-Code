# Ill-Conditioned System of Linear Equations

## Problem Statement

Given the system of linear equations:
\[
3x + 1.5y = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
2x + 1.02y = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Determine whether the system is ill-conditioned by changing the coefficient 1.02 in Equation 2 to 1.03 and analyzing the impact on the solution.

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Solve the Original System

We first solve the system as it is:

1. Multiply Equation 1 by 2 to eliminate x:
\[
   6x + 3y = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
   
2. Multiply Equation 2 by 3 to eliminate y:
\[
   6x + 3.06y = 6 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]
   
3. Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4 to find y:
\[
   0.06y = 4
\]
\[
   y = \frac{4}{0.06} = 66.67
\]
   
4. Substitute y = 66.67 into Equation 1 to find x:
\[
   3x + 100 = 1
\]
\[
   x = \frac{-99}{3} = -33
\]

The solution to the original system is x = -33, y = 66.67.

### Step 2: Solve the Modified System

Next, we change the coefficient in Equation 2 from 1.02 to 1.03 and solve the modified system:

1. Replace Equation 2 with:
\[
   2x + 1.03y = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]
   
2. Multiply Equation 5 by 3:
\[
   6x + 3.09y = 6 \quad \text{(Equation 6)}
\]
   
3. Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 6 to find y:
\[
   0.09y = 4
\]
\[
   y = \frac{4}{0.09} \approx 44.44
\]
   
4. Substitute y = 44.44 into Equation 1 to find x:
\[
   3x + 66.66 = 1
\]
\[
   x = \frac{-65.66}{3} \approx -21.89
\]

The solution to the modified system is x \approx -21.89, y \approx 44.44.

### Step 3: Determine if the System is Ill-Conditioned

An ill-conditioned system is characterized by a small change in coefficients causing a large change in the solution. In this case:

- The original solution was x = -33, y = 66.67.
- The modified solution is x \approx -21.89, y \approx 44.44.

Given the significant difference in solutions due to the small change from 1.02 to 1.03, the system is **ill-conditioned**.

## Conclusion

The given system of equations is ill-conditioned, as a minor change in the coefficient leads to a significant variation in the solutions for x and y.
